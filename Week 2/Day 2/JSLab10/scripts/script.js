/*Explanation
A block of code is defined by {}. Everything in between 
Those curly braces is considered in the block. 
Anything else is outside of the block. 

If statements allow us to run a block of code only if a 
specific condition is true. 
If the condition in the parentheses is true the block 
following the the parentheses will run. 

We can optionally have an else statement that will run 
only if the other block doesn't run. 
*/ 

/*Example*/ 
let input = prompt("Do you like cookies?\n"
                    +"y for yes");//saves the result of the user input in the variable input

if(input ==="y"){
    console.log("I love Chocolate Chip cookies.");
}else{
    console.log("It was nice knowing you.");

/*Your turn 
Modify the code above this to print your favorite 
cookie if the user inputs y.

/*Example */
let number = prompt("Give me a number between 1 and 10");
//The above saves the value of the user input for the corresponding prompt in
//the variable named number. 
number= Number(number);//converts the input into a number;

/*Your turn 
Write an if statment that checks if the user 
typed a number in the correct range. 
If they did alert them with the message Nice Job!
Otherwise, alert them with the message that they need to be better
at following the instructions. 

Hint: && and || allow you to combine conditional statements

/*Example 
What if we want to check multiple conditions? 
We can also say 
else if (another condition){instructions}

 “x is greater than 5”. Write another else-if statement 
 to check if x is less than or equal to 0. If so, it
