    <p>My name is Mark. I grew up in Ohio where I went camping and learned country life. I found a great fascination in computers and video games and look forward to learning how to write programming languages in the future.</p>
      <br />
        <p>I moved to Maryland later in life and am now engaging in starting a class, and a potential dream career with Revature where I can continue growing.</p>
        <span>Failure is not an option.</span> <span>Victory is in my veins.</span>
