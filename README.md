Spark 4-Weeks
Welcome to Spark!
You have enrolled in a four-week-long intensive training program that will teach you the fundamentals of software development. The ultimate goal of the Spark program is to give you a strong foundation so that you can continue improving independently - you should walk away with the knowledge of what questions you need to ask next, and the ability to understand the answers. Students who complete the Spark program and perform well may be given a training and job offer by Revature.

For this program, the content on RevaturePro will be the primary source of information. Below, you will find videos to watch, quizzes to take, lab assignments and small projects to complete. There are also some additional resources to review for the Spark program.
